# Evaluation of HEATEOAS support by Java frameworks
This repository contains the source code for the evaluation part of my bachelor thesis.

## Build
Plain standard maven install in the evaluation dir: 
```
cd evaluation
mvn clean install
```

## Branching
This branch (rfmm_lvl3) contains the tests to check if the frameworks are compliant to the REST Framework Maturity Model level 3.
Any further details can be found in the thesis itself.
